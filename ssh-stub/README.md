# IMPORTANT
I tend to keep ssh-configs machine-specific but I realize that certain 
patterns are similar. I used to sync that up with a local git repo
that I sync'd between machines but today I'm setting up a machine that
I can't rely on this method for. So instead, I'm adding this stub and
will figure out a way to build an ssh-config file using it down the road.
